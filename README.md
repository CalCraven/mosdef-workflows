### MoSDeF Workflows

A collection of sample workflows using MoSDeF tools

The Molecular Simulation Design Framework [(MoSDeF)] (https://mosdef.org) tools, supports a wide range of simulation engines, including `Cassandra <https://cassandra.nd.edu), [GPU Optimized Monte Carlo (GOMC)] (http://gomc.eng.wayne.edu), [GROMACS] (https://www.gromacs.org), [HOOMD-blue] (http://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/), and [Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS)] (https://lammps.sandia.gov).  The **MoSDeF** tools allow simulation reproducibility across the various simulation engines, eliminating the need to be an expert user in all the engines to replicate, continue, or advance the existing research.  Additionally, the software can auto-generate many different systems, allowing large-scale screening of chemicals and materials using [Signac] (https://signac.io) to manage the simulations and data.

The [MoSDeF] (https://mosdef.org) software is comprised the following major packages:
    * [mBuild] (https://mbuild.mosdef.org/en/stable/) -- A hierarchical, component based molecule builder
    * [foyer] (https://foyer.mosdef.org/en/stable/) -- A package for atom-typing as well as applying and disseminating forcefields
    * [GMSO] (https://gmso.mosdef.org/en/stable/) -- Flexible storage of chemical topology for molecular simulation
